##Question 0
The interactive tutorial was good but there were some hiccups found during the last class session that I think the instructors are already aware of and may have fixed. It was very useful to learn about pipes and how they are pretty similiar to how pipes work in R's tidyverse package. The redirection > is also really useful to save output to a text file for later. I can see how shell scripting can help automate some tasks surronding file managment that may have otherwise taken a really long time to do.
